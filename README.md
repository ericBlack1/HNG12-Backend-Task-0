# FastAPI Project

This is a simple FastAPI project that returns a JSON response with your email, the current datetime in ISO 8601 format (UTC), and a GitHub repository URL.

## Project Description

The project is a RESTful API built using **FastAPI**, a modern Python web framework. It responds to `GET` requests with a JSON object containing:
- Your email address.
- The current datetime in ISO 8601 format (UTC).
- A link to your GitHub repository.

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a FastAPI application with proper documentation and deployment instructions.
